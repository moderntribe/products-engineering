						"content": "Hooks vs constants\n\nOccasionally we may have a request or an idea for a setting that could be useful to advanced users, but that isn’t something we’d want to expose to everyone in the plugin’s settings pages. In those cases, we’ll usually want to create a “hidden” setting that is available for users to set the value of via a hook or a constant.\n\nWhen to Use a Hook\nMost of the time hooks should be used to create these hidden settings. A user will then be able to create a line in their functions.php which sets the value.\n\nWhen to Use a Constant\nConstants should only be used when a site owner will want to set a setting site-wide, no matter what theme or plugins are in use, and no theme or plugin should be allowed to override this value. A user will then be able to create a line in their wp-config.php which sets the value.\n\nNOTE: if a Modern Tribe developer would like to suggest a constant be used, they will need to bring it up during the code review that happens once per release cycle. Pull requests that add constants to the codebase will also need to be discussed on Modern Tribe’s internal code review before they are accepted.\n\nHooking from Within Objects\nVery often an object will need to add a number of actions and filters of its own. As a rule of thumb, any add_action() or add_filter() calls should be contained inside a hook() method and should not be setup from within the constructor.\n\nHow to deprecate\n\nWhen a global function or hook needs to be renamed or taken out of use, please take the following steps:\n\n\n  For functions, move the function to the deprecated.php file\n  Place an @deprecated phpDoc docblock tag in the documentation for the function or hook\n  Place an @todo in the phpDoc docblock that describes when to remove the function. It should be a minimum of two versions into the future.\n  For functions, run WordPress’ _deprecated_function() just inside function\n  For hooks, check has_filter(), and if it returns true, run the WordPress _deprecated_function() just above the hook\n\n\nNOTE: private and protected class members don’t need to be deprecated."

						"content": "Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.\n\nIf you already have a full Ruby development environment with all headers and RubyGems installed, you can create a new Jekyll site by doing the following:\n\nHow to install\n\n# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems\n~ $ gem install jekyll bundler\n\n# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog\n~ $ jekyll new myblog\n\n# Change into your new directory\n~ $ cd myblog\n\n# Build the site on the preview server\n~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve\n\n# Now browse to http://localhost:4000\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\nBuilding a Jekyll site with the default theme is just the first step. The real magic happens when you start creating blog posts, using the front matter to control templates and layouts, and taking advantage of all the awesome configuration options Jekyll makes available.\n\nBasic usage\n\nThe Jekyll gem makes a jekyll executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use this command in a number of ways:\n\n$ jekyll build\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site\n\n$ jekyll build --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --source &lt;source&gt; --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The &lt;source&gt; folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --watch\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site,\n#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.\n\n\n\nDirectory structure\n\nJekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. This is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the final product.\n\nA basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:\n\n.\n├── _config.yml\n├── _data\n|   └── members.yml\n├── _drafts\n|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md\n|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md\n├── _includes\n|   ├── footer.html\n|   └── header.html\n├── _layouts\n|   ├── default.html\n|   └── post.html\n├── _posts\n|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md\n|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md\n├── _sass\n|   ├── _base.scss\n|   └── _layout.scss\n├── _site\n├── .jekyll-metadata\n└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid YAML Frontmatter\n\n\n\nFront matter\n\nThe front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:\n\n---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Blogging Like a Hacker\n---\n\n\n\nBetween these triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables (see below for a reference) or even create custom ones of your own. These variables will then be available to you to access using Liquid tags both further down in the file and also in any layouts or includes that the page or post in question relies on.\n\n\n\nWhere additional pages live\n\nWhere you put HTML or Markdown files for pages depends on how you want the pages to work. There are two main ways of creating pages:\n\n\n  Place named HTML or Markdown files for each page in your site’s root folder.\n  Place pages inside folders and subfolders named whatever you want.\n\n\nBoth methods work fine (and can be used in conjunction with each other), with the only real difference being the resulting URLs. By default, pages retain the same folder structure in _site as they do in the source directory."

						"content": "The Basics\n\nFirst and foremost, we make an attempt to adhere to the WordPress PHP coding standards. Additionally, we attempt to follow a number of PSR-2 standards where they don’t conflict with WordPress.\n\n Overview\n\n\n  Visibility MUST be declared on all properties and methods; abstract and final MUST be declared before the visibility; static MUST be declared after the visibility.\n  The soft limit on line length MUST be 120 characters; automated style checkers MUST warn but MUST NOT error at the soft limit.\n\n\n General\n\n Files\n\n\n  All PHP files MUST use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending.\n  The closing ?&gt; tag MUST be omitted from files containing only or ending in PHP.\n\n\n Keywords and true/false/null\n\n\n  PHP keywords MUS be in lowercase.\n  The PHP constants true, false, and null MUST be in lowercase.\n\n\n Namespace and use declarations\n\nWhere we are able to use Namespaces (tests, SaaS code, etc), we should adhere to the PSR-2 standards for Namespaces and Use Declarations.\n\nClasses, properties, and methods\n\nWhen creating a new class, please try to ensure that the class has a single responsibility. Use inheritance when possible to keep things simple, organized and DRY.\n\nClass naming\n\nClasses should be named with the Modern Tribe namespace (“Tribe”), the plugin namespace (“Events”), and then the classname. Those three parts should be separated by double underscores (which will translate to directory slashes in the autoloader). Since we’re using double underscores as namespace separators, you can (and should) use single underscores in the class names.\n\nExample: Naming a Class\n\nWrong (not namespaced, uses CamelCase):\n\n\nclass DateUtilities {\n\t// define some things\n}\n\n\nRight:\n\nClasses should be namespaced with a hierarchy that is separated by double-underscores (__). The hierarchy is as such: src/Tribe/Class_Name. In the class name, that translates to:\n\n\nclass Tribe__Events__Date_Utilities {\n\t// define some things\n}\n\n\nProperties\n\nWe adhere to the PSR-2 guidelines for properties.\n\nConstants\n\nDue to the difficulty of deprecating constants (const), we prefer the use of public static class properties. This way, if we wish to deprecate the property, we can communicate that deprecation via magic __get() methods.\n\n\n// bad\nconst BACON = 'yummy';\n\n// preferred\npublic static $bacon = 'yummy';\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n  Visibility MUST be declared on all methods.\n  Method names SHOULD NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate protected or private visibility.\n  Method names MUST NOT be declared with a space after the method name.\n  For public methods that we want to deter public use, use the @internal docblock tag rather than an underscore prefix.\n  The default visibility for class members should be private. Increase the visibility incrementally (to protected, and then public), as needed.\n  Static methods and properties should be used sparingly and avoided whenever possible.\n  Be as DRY as possible.\n\n\nMethod arguments\n\nArgument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.\n\nWhen the argument list is split across multiple lines, the closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them.\n\nExample:\n\npublic function star_wars(\n  $episode,\n  $character,\n  $species,\n  $weapon\n) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n\n\n Abstract, final, and static\n\nWe adhere to the PSR-2 guidelines for abstract, final and static.\n\n Method and function calls\n\nArgument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.\n\nExample:\n\n\nstar_wars(\n  'IV',\n  'Greedo',\n  'Rodian',\n  'DT-12'\n);\n\n\n Functions\n\nWhen to create global functions\nIf there is a piece of code that is frequently referenced throughout the addons, or could be useful to users who want to create custom templates or addons, that’s when it’s appropriate to create a global function.\n\nKeep in mind that whenever a global function is created and released, from that point on, it’ll be “in the wild”. Customers may be using it in their themes or plugins, and we will need to support it from that point on. With this in mind, please be sure not to create unnecessary functions that we won’t want to support.\n\nWhere to put function code\nThere are template tag files for most areas of the plugin. They are located in the template-tags/ directory. Take care in selecting the appropriate file for your new function, and place the new function at the end of the file. If it closely references another function in the file, place it next to that function.\n\nIt’s usually appropriate to place the logic for a function into a class, and then use a function as a wrapper for the class method. When you have some code that you’d like to make publicly available, but it would also make sense as a method of one of our classes, you should make the method within the class, and then make a global function that calls that method and returns its result.\n\nEcho or return?\nWhen a function returns a scalar value that might be used in templates, be sure to return the value instead of echoing it. There is no need to take $echo as a boolean argument to the function; if a user wants to echo the value, they can simply directly echo the function’s result in their template.\n\nApplying filters to the result\nNote that whenever you create a global function, be sure to run apply_filters() on the result before it’s returned.\n\nThe filter should have the same name as the function, and should be passed the return value, followed by (at minimum), all parameters that were passed to the function initially.\n\nFunction naming\nSince we’re creating code that is distributed, has been downloaded over 1 million times, and will be installed alongside myriad themes and plugins, it’s very important that you prefix your global namespace definitions with tribe_ – so there’s far less chance another plugin’s or theme’s definitions will have the same name.\n\nExample: Naming a Global Function\n\nWrong (not namespaced, uses camelCase):\n\n\nfunction getEventStartTime() {\n\t// do something\n}\n\n\nRight (prefixed with tribe_, uses underscores):\n\n\nfunction tribe_get_event_start_time() {\n\t// do something\n}\n\n\n Control structures\n\nSwitch, case\n\nWe adhere to the PSR-2 guidelines for switch and case statements except for the standards around spacing within parentheses.\n\nMulti-line control structures\n\nConditionals MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first conditional in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one conditional per line.\n\nYup!\n\n// simple\nif (\n  $a == $b\n  &amp;&amp; $b == $c\n) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n\n// something a bit more complex\nif (\n  (\n    $a == $b\n    || $a == c\n  )\n  &amp;&amp; $b == $d\n  &amp;&amp; $q == $banana_pancake\n) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n\n\nNope!\n\n// this only looks pretty when your tabs are set to 2 spaces\nif ( $a == $b\n  &amp;&amp; $b == $c\n) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n\n// alignment beyond a single tab can be fraught with differences between devs\nif ( $a == $b\n     &amp;&amp; $b == $c\n) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n\n// this one causes needless churn in Git as conditionals are added to the control structure\nif (\n  $a == $b &amp;&amp;\n  $b == $c\n) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n\n// since we use tabs, we could be bitten by the tab/space nature of alignment here\nif (\n     $a == $b\n  &amp;&amp; $b == $c\n) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n\n// something a bit more complex - this violates the 1 conditional per line rule\nif (\n  ( $a == $b || $a == c )\n  &amp;&amp; $b == $d\n  &amp;&amp; $q == $banana_pancake\n) {\n  // do stuff\n}\n\n\n Closures\n\nWe adhere to the PSR-2 guidelines for closuers except for the standards around spacing within parentheses."

						"content": "The Basics\n\nFirst and foremost, we make an attempt to adhere to the WordPress JS coding standards.\n\n Code style\n\nAll javascript should be well documented. Functions, namespaces should adhere to the jsdoc 3 standard, available here: [[http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html]].\n\nInside functions declare additional comments with the // syntax.\n\nVariable declaration\n\nWhile not a fully ratified standard, nor heavily enforced, comma separated variable declarations should be discouraged.\n\nIcky:\n\n\nvar v, x, y;\n\nvar $this = $(this),\n  $that = $(that),\n  i = 0;\n\n\nPreferred:\n\n\nvar v;\nvar x;\nvar y;\n\nvar $this = $( this );\nvar $that = $( that );\nvar i     = 0;\n\n\nHere’s @borkweb’s reasoning for separate var statements\n\nPersonally, I’d prefer separating the function declarations from the variable declaration chain. One of the following would allow proper docblocks without chunking up the declarations and avoid funky-looking nesting:\n\n\nvar date_to_ymd = function( date ) {\n  // ...\n};\n\n\nor\n\n\nfunction date_to_ymd( date ) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nI still am not a fan of chained declaration in general. Here’s my reasoning:\n\n\n  \n    Chained declarations deter comments being added for individual variables and sorta hurt readability:\n\n    \n var\n   /**\n    * This variable does something interesting\n    *\n    * @private\n    **/\n   variable_x = 1,\n\n   /**\n    * This variable does something else entirely\n    *\n    * @private\n    **/\n   variable_y = 2;\n \n  \n  \n    Chained declaration statements make them harder to move around and causes needless churn in diffs and increases the possibility of merge conflicts:\n\n    \n var x = 1,\n   z = 3,\n   y = 2;\n\n // changing it to the following would result in 2 changed lines:\n\n var x = 1,\n   y = 2,\n   z = 3;\n \n\n    vs the following:\n\n    \n var x = 1;\n var z = 3;\n var y = 2;\n\n // change it to the following would result in 1 changed line:\n\n var x = 1;\n var y = 2;\n var z = 3;\n \n  \n  \n    Variable alignment of chained declarations is unpleasing to my brain (I know I could solve this by setting my tabs to 4…but that’s not going to happen):\n\n    \n // compare this\n var x = 1,\n   y = 2,\n   z = 3;\n\n // to:\n var x = 1;\n var y = 2;\n var z = 3;\n \n  \n  \n    Our unminified code should be all about readability and not saving bytes. Good minifiers turn multiple var statements into comma separated ones.\n  \n  \n    On the topic of saving bytes…In the event that the non-minified version of the JS file is served up to the user…two var statements gzip better than a single var with a comma. (via Isaac of NPM - source)\n  \n\n\njQuery var names\n\nVariables that point to a jQuery object should have their name prefixed with a $ sign, per the examples above.\n\nUtility functions, state, tests and options for the main plugins should be stored in\ntribe-events.js and tribe-events-pro.js.\n\nIf functions or portions of functionality move between plugins, make sure all associated js code\nmoves to that new area with them.\n\n Event namespacing\n\nTo promote flexible event handling within jQuery, namespacing events is preferred over prefixing custom event names.\n\nWhy?\n\nNamespacing allows a developer to add and remove events in an isolated fashion.  CSS-Tricks has an excellent write-up about why they are awesome.\n\nNamespacing conventions\n\nNamespaced custom events should use the following convention:\n\n[event name].tribe\n\n\n\n[event name]\n\nThe [event name] should be something that indicates the action that is occurring. If saving a ticket, an event name of save-ticket would be appropriate - fry-bacon would not.\n\ntribe\n\nThis is the piece of the namespace that should be present everywhere. It separates our events from those of other plugins."

As you are working on\nThe Events Calendar codebase, if you see any blocks of code that don’t follow these guidelines, feel\nfree to update and improve them to bring them in line with our style.\n\nGround Rules\n\nWhile everyone has their own way of solving problems and writing algorithms, there are some basic\nguidelines we should all strive to follow.\n\nRule 1: Make sure your code is written in such a way that another developer could look at it and know what it does without much effort.\n\nThis includes not making overly complex or nested loop structures and conditional statements –\nremember to K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid!).\n\nExample: Nested Levels &amp; Excess Comparisons\n\nRight:\n\n// this does the exact same thing!\nif ( empty ( $date ) ) {\n\treturn false;\n}\n\nif ( $date &gt; $date1 ) {\n\t// do something\n} else if ( $date &lt; $date 2 ) {\n\t// do something else\n}\n\n\n\nWrong:\n\n// too many nested levels and convoluted logic\nif (  ! empty ( $date ) &amp;&amp; ( $date &gt; $date1 || $date &lt; $date2 ) ) {\n\tif ( $date &gt; $date1 ) {\n\t\t// do something\n\t} else if ($date &lt; $date2 ) {\n\t\t// do something else\n\t}\n} else {\n\tif ( empty ( $date) ) {\n\treturn false;\n} }\n\n\n\nExample: Sacrificing Readability for Being Clever\n\nRight:\n\n// this does the same thing.. a few extra lines, but it’s far more readable:\n$tribe_events_template = tribe_get_option( 'tribeEventsTemplate', 'default' );\nif ( $tribe_events_template == 'default' ) {\n\t$tribe_events_template = 'page.php';\n}\n$template = locate_template( $tribe_events_template );\n\n\n\nWrong:\n\n// believe it or not, this is all in one line:\n$template = locate_template( tribe_get_option( 'tribeEventsTemplate', 'default' ) == 'default' ? 'page.php' : tribe_get_option( 'tribeEventsTemplate', 'default' ) );\n\n\n\nRule 2: Name your functions and variables plainly and descriptively.\n\nIf you’re good at this, sometimes comments and confusion can both be avoided!\n\nEx. 3, Function &amp; variable naming\n\nRight:\n\n// clearly named variables and function\n$days_between = tribe_calc_days_between( $start_date, $end_date );\n\n\n\nWrong:\n\n// non-descript variable and function names\n$x = how_many($y, $z);\n\n\n\nRule 3: D.R.Y. (Don’t Repeat Yourself).\n\nIf you ever find yourself duplicating a line of code, there’s probably something wrong. Go back and\nfigure out how you can solve the problem without any duplicate code (i.e. create a function or a\nvariable that you can reuse).\n\nWhen developing Modern Tribe products, following the D.R.Y. rule also means: don’t write new code\nwhen there already exists functionality in PHP, WordPress, or elsewhere in the products suite, which\ndoes the same thing. Before writing a new function, please do your due diligence and check that the\nfunctionality you need doesn’t already exist somewhere else.\n\nRule 4: Be sure to include clear and accurate comments.\n\nOccasionally a complex solution to a problem will be required, and when you realize that it’s not\nimmediately clear what a block of your code is doing, you should add an extra line break above it,\nand enter a comment, for the benefit of your teammates who might encounter this block of code in the\nfuture. Keep in mind that it’ll only take you 30 seconds, but could save someone else 5 minutes or\nmore.\n\nNote that comments are usually added as a quick afterthought, and are therefore prone to containing\ntypos. Please take a moment to double check your comments for spelling mistakes and clarity."

When contributing CSS changes to our plugins, please\nbe sure to edit files within src/resources/postcss rather than src/resources/css. Getting your environment set up to work with our\nPostCSS configuration is fairly simple:\n\nPrequisite: Install node.js\n\n\n  In the root directory of the plugin, type npm install. If you have already run that command, it is always advised to run npm update\n  Edit PostCSS (.pcss) files in src/resources/postcss to your heart’s content\n  Compile the PostCSS into CSS by running gulp\n\n\n PostCSS plugins\n\nWe employ a number of PostCSS plugins to transform our .pcss files into CSS. They are as follows:\n\nPostCSS CSSNext\n\nPostCSS-cssnext is a PostCSS plugin that helps you to use the latest CSS syntax today. It transforms\nnew CSS specs into more compatible CSS so you don’t need to wait for browser support.\n\nPostCSS Import\n\nThis plugin allows you to @import rules from another file. Simply add @import 'somefile.css';\nand it will inject the contents of somefile.css.\n\nPostCSS Nested\n\nPostCSS plugin to unwrap nested rules like how Sass does it. Basically…it provides support for rule nesting.\n\nPostCSS Mixins\n\nThis plugin adds support for mixins similar to Sass, however the syntax is a bit different. You define mixins via @define-mixin mixinname {}\nand you include the mixin via @mixin mixinname;.\n\nPostCSS MediaQuery Packer\n\nThis plugin merges identical media queries during compilation into CSS.\n\n CSS Basics\n\nFirst and foremost, we make an attempt to adhere to the WordPress CSS coding standards.\nThere is an exception to this rule, however…Property Ordering.\n\n Property ordering\n\nThere are a few strategies for ordering CSS properties out in the wild. The approach we take is alphabetical ordering of properties.\n\nAvoid\n\n\n.thing {\n  color: #555;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  background: #eee;\n  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\n     -moz-border-radius: 5px;\n          border-radius: 5px;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 20px;\n  left: 10px;\n}\n\n\nPrefer\n\n\n.thing {\n  background: #eee;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;\n     -moz-border-radius: 5px;\n          border-radius: 5px;\n  color: #555;\n  left: 10px;\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 20px;\n}\n\n\n Specificity\n\nBe sure to use efficient selectors.\nClasses have a nice balance between reusability and efficiency, so their use is preferred over other\nselectors if possible.\n\n!important\n\nAs a general rule, don’t use !important unless you absolutely must. Be prepared to justify its\nusage during the code review process."

At the end of a\nrelease cycle, release branches are merged into the master branch. The master\nbranch should generally not be committed to, except by the developer in charge of releasing the plugin.\n\nNOTE: if you need to test something against the currently released version of the plugin, a\nsimple way to switch to that version is by checking out the master branch. Just be sure to switch\nback to your working branch before you make any commits!\n\nMajor feature branches\n\nMajor feature branches are where we work on new development for our products. These branches act as\na shared location for developers to Pull Request work specific to the feature being developed. Major\nfeature branches should have a Milestone associated with them in GitHub that specifies the branch name.\nWhen a major feature is determined, it should be branched from the latest Tagged release and all\ncode for that feature should be Pull Requested into that branch rather than direct committed and pushed.\n\nWhen major/maintenance releases are released, the developers that are leading the feature work\nare in charge of merging master into their respective feature branches.\n\nMajor release branches\n\nWhen one or more features are ready for release prep, a release/x.y branch should be created from\nthe latest tagged release and the feature branches should be Pull Requested into that release branch.\n\nMaintenance release branches\n\nWhile working on a maintenance release, most code should be developed in the corresponding release\nbranch (release/x.y.z). This should be considered the primary working branch during every\nmaintenance release cycle.\n\nOther branches\n\nNOTE: The following instructions are for internal use only, if you’re sending a pull request,\nit’ll already be in its own branch.\n\nIf you find yourself assigned to a ticket you anticipate may need extreme QA effort, break other\nareas of the plugin, or has the potential (for any reason) not to be finished in a single release\ncycle, please create a branch off of develop, and do your work in there.\n\nThe naming convention for new branches should be as such - &lt;feature|fix&gt;/&lt;ticket number&gt;-&lt;brief-description&gt;. For example:\n\nfeature/24343-activation-page\nor\nfix/28363-list-view-eod-cutoff\n\nPlease ensure that the prefix (“feature” or “bugfix”) corresponds to the issue tracker selected in\nthe ticket.\n\n Code reviews\n\nAll code that is intended to be merged to develop, master, or a release branch must first\nundergo code review.\n\nCode reviews must be done by a core product engineer. (Barry, Gustavo, Matt, or Zach)\n\nWhen an engineer has code ready for merging, they should create a pull request that includes a link\nback to the ticket in Modern Tribe’s Internal Central Tickets (“Central”).  If the request is coming\nfrom a 3rd party contributor, a Modern Tribe representative should create a ticket in Central to\ntrack this change and add a link in a comment on the pull request.  In Central, a reciprocal link\nshould be added to link back to any pull requests associated with the ticket and the ticket status\nshould be set to “Pending Code Review”.\n\nReviewers should consider the following:\n\n\n  Does this code meet our standards?\n  Is the pull request against the correct branch?\n  Does the solution make sense?\n  Will this solution lead to other problems? (compatibility, performance, etc)\n\n\nOnce a reviewer has approved a pull request, they should leave a comment on the pull request and\nchange the Central ticket status to “Pending QA”.  At this point it should undergo QA.  Assuming QA\npasses, the status on the ticket should be changed to “Pending Merge”.  Once the original requestor\n(or Modern Tribe representative) gets approval, they should merge the code and change the status in\nthe ticket to “Pending Smoketest” or “Pending Release” as appropriate.\n\n Labels for pull requests\n\n\n  \n    \n      Label\n      Description\n      Who\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      code review\n      The PR is awaiting code review.\n      Added by the pull request submitter. Removed by code reviewer.\n    \n    \n      in-qa\n      The code was approved and now is ready to be QA’d\n      Added by the code reviewer. Removed when merge label is added or if fails QA.\n    \n    \n      merge\n      Work on the ticket has been reviewed and tested.
