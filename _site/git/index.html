<h3 id="master-branch">Master branch</h3>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch contains the public, currently released version of the plugin. At the end of a
release cycle, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">develop</code> branch is merged into the master branch. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>
branch should generally not be committed to, except by the developer in charge of releasing the plugin.</p>

<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> if you need to test something against the currently released version of the plugin, a
simple way to switch to that version is by checking out the master branch. Just be sure to switch
back to your working branch before you make any commits!</em></p>

<h3 id="develop-branch">Develop branch</h3>
<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">develop</code> branch is the current working branch for the next major release. All public Pull
Requests should be submitted to that branch. If the PR fixes a bug, it may find its way into a
Maintenance Release branch.</p>

<h3 id="maintenance-release-branches">Maintenance release branches</h3>

<p>While working on a maintenance release, most code should be developed in the corresponding release
branch (<code class="highlighter-rouge">release/x.y.z</code>). This should be considered the primary working branch during every
maintenance release cycle.</p>

<h3 id="other-branches">Other branches</h3>

<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> The following instructions are for internal use only, if you’re sending a pull request,
it’ll already be in its own branch.</em></p>

<p>If you find yourself assigned to a ticket you anticipate may need extreme QA effort, break other
areas of the plugin, or has the potential (for any reason) not to be finished in a single release
cycle, please create a branch off of develop, and do your work in there.</p>

<p>The naming convention for new branches should be as such - <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;feature|fix&gt;/&lt;ticket number&gt;-&lt;brief-description&gt;</code>. For example:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">feature/24343-activation-page</code>
or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">fix/28363-list-view-eod-cutoff</code></p>

<p>Please ensure that the prefix (“feature” or “bugfix”) corresponds to the issue tracker selected in
the ticket.</p>

<h2 id="a-idgit-code-reviewa-code-reviews"><a id="git-code-review"></a> Code reviews</h2>

<p><strong>All code that is intended to be merged to <code class="highlighter-rouge">develop</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>, or a <code class="highlighter-rouge">release</code> branch must first
undergo code review.</strong></p>

<p>Code reviews must be done by a core product engineer. (Barry, Gustavo, Matt, or Zach)</p>

<p>When an engineer has code ready for merging, they should create a pull request that includes a link
back to the ticket in Modern Tribe’s Internal Central Tickets (“Central”).  If the request is coming
from a 3rd party contributor, a Modern Tribe representative should create a ticket in Central to
track this change and add a link in a comment on the pull request.  In Central, a reciprocal link
should be added to link back to any pull requests associated with the ticket and the ticket status
should be set to “Pending Code Review”.</p>

<p>Reviewers should consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does this code meet <a href="/">our standards</a>?</li>
  <li>Is the pull request against the correct branch?</li>
  <li>Does the solution make sense?</li>
  <li>Will this solution lead to other problems? (compatibility, performance, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a reviewer has approved a pull request, they should leave a comment on the pull request and
change the Central ticket status to “Pending QA”.  At this point it should undergo QA.  Assuming QA
passes, the status on the ticket should be changed to “Pending Merge”.  Once the original requestor
(or Modern Tribe representative) gets approval, they should merge the code and change the status in
the ticket to “Pending Smoketest” or “Pending Release” as appropriate.</p>
