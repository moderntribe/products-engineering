## <a id="postcss"></a> PostCSS

The CSS within Modern Tribe plugins built/transformed with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss). When contributing CSS changes to our plugins, please
be sure to edit files within <code>src/resources/postcss</code> rather than <code>src/resources/css</code>. Getting your environment set up to work with our
PostCSS configuration is fairly simple:

Prequisite: [Install node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

1. In the root directory of the plugin, type <code>npm install</code>. If you have already run that command, it is always advised to run <code>npm update</code>
1. Edit PostCSS (<code>.pcss</code>) files in <code>src/resources/postcss</code> to your heart's content
1. Compile the PostCSS into CSS by running <code>gulp</code>

### <a id="postcss-plugins"></a> PostCSS plugins

We employ a number of PostCSS plugins to transform our <code>.pcss</code> files into CSS. They are as follows:

**[PostCSS CSSNext](http://cssnext.io/)**

PostCSS-cssnext is a PostCSS plugin that helps you to use the latest CSS syntax today. It transforms
new CSS specs into more compatible CSS so you don't need to wait for browser support.

**[PostCSS Import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)**

This plugin allows you to <code>@import</code> rules from another file. Simply add <code>@import 'somefile.css';</code>
and it will inject the contents of <code>somefile.css</code>.

**[PostCSS Nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested)**

PostCSS plugin to unwrap nested rules like how Sass does it. Basically...it provides support for rule nesting.

**[PostCSS Mixins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-mixins)**

This plugin adds support for mixins similar to Sass, however the syntax is a bit different. You define mixins via <code>@define-mixin mixinname {}</code>
and you include the mixin via <code>@mixin mixinname;</code>.

**[PostCSS MediaQuery Packer](https://github.com/hail2u/node-css-mqpacker)**

This plugin merges identical media queries during compilation into CSS.

## <a id="css-basics"></a> CSS Basics

First and foremost, we make an attempt to adhere to the [WordPress CSS coding standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/css/).
There is an exception to this rule, however...**Property Ordering**.

## <a id="css-property-ordering"></a> Property ordering

There are a few strategies for ordering CSS properties out in the wild. The approach we take is alphabetical ordering of properties.

**Avoid**

<pre>
.thing {
  color: #555;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  background: #eee;
  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;
     -moz-border-radius: 5px;
          border-radius: 5px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 10px;
}
</pre>

**Prefer**

<pre>
.thing {
  background: #eee;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  -webkit-border-radius: 5px;
     -moz-border-radius: 5px;
          border-radius: 5px;
  color: #555;
  left: 10px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
}
</pre>

## <a id="css-specificity"></a> Specificity

Be sure to use [efficient selectors](http://csswizardry.com/2011/09/writing-efficient-css-selectors/).
Classes have a nice balance between reusability and efficiency, so their use is preferred over other
selectors if possible.

### !important

As a general rule, don't use `!important` unless you absolutely must. Be prepared to justify its
usage during the code review process.
