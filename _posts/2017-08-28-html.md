## The basics

First and foremost, we make an attempt to adhere to the [WordPress HTML coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/html/).

## Code style

* HTML blocks should be nested and indented logically
* The initial indent should consist only of tabs and not spaces
* PHP blocks are indented according to the same rules as HTML elements
* Single line segments of PHP like our `esc_html_e()` call still terminate with a semi-colon

Example:

```html
&lt;div id="component"&gt;
	&lt;div class="part"&gt;
		&lt;?php if ( 'met' === $condition ): ?&gt;
			&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;?php esc_html_e( 'Follow this link', 'textdomain' ); ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

### Multiline attributes

Just as with PHP or Javascript, we should strive to avoid overly-long lines of code as this can harm readability.
In particular, if there are a large number of attributes for a given element then it can be desirable to break them
up over multiple lines. In such a case we use the following convention:

```html
&lt;div
	id="some-id"
	class="some-class"
	data-some-data="1"
&gt;
	&lt;!-- Inner HTML --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```
